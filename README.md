# Intel-ReAI: Keeping Integrity while Maintaining Intelligence
##### Brought to you by Ikram A, Ankit D, Hans J & Ivan T

This project is developed for HackMIT 2025, with the intent to submit for Y Combinator's Challenge: “Challenge an Iconic YC Company with AI”
We decided to reform Reddit as if it were born in 2025 with AI at its core.
Hence, our overarching goal:
- #### We want to build a more intelligent system to facilitate community findings and buildings, since human-centered discussion in today's AI dominated age is highly valuable.

## Project Features (courtesy of Claude API):
- Agentic Workflow: Summarizes reddit threads and provides citation, allowing users to save time instead of scrolling endless text without insight. 
- Subreddit AI Companion (in order to facilitate community-building):
    - Message filtering: We need to maintain the authenticity of the posts, so AI-biased content is filtered out.
    - Establishment of rules: 
    - FAQs about community/subreddit: autogenerated onboarding agent 
    - Monitoring poses: Politically disruptive posts and NSFWs can be easily targeted, allowing for a safer culture.
- Personalized Feed
    - Analyzes the general thread of a user's interests through browsing history; extract keywords or trends to produce relevant or similar topics 

  
## Execution
We created a mock-off Reddit site as part of our MVP goal of testing the basic functionalities of our project features.
