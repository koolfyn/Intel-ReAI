# Intel-ReAI: Keeping Integrity while Maintaining Intelligence

This project is developed for HackMIT 2025, with the intent to submit for Y Combinator's Challenge: “Challenge an Iconic YC Company with AI”
We decided to reform Reddit as if it were born in 2025 with AI at its core.
Hence, our overarching goal:
- #### We want to build a more intelligent system to facilitate community findings and buildings, since human-centered discussion in today's AI dominated age is highly valuable.

## Features (courtesy of Claude API):
- Agentic Workflow: Summarizes reddit threads and provides citation, allowing users to save time instead of scrolling endless text without insight. 
- Subreddit AI Companion (in order to facilitate community-building):
    - Message filtering
    - Establishment of rules
    - FAQs about community/subreddit
- Personalized Feed
    - Analyzes the general thread of a user's interests
